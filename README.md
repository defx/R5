# R5

Minimalist HTML templating library with declarative data/event binding and reactive updates, using standard ES Template Literals.

## Agnostic

R5 is highly _unopinionated_ - you can use it with (or without!) any component and/or state architecture you desire.

## Similarity to lit-html (or some other library)

Yes it is very similar in many ways! lit-html is an awesome library, and has quite a few more features than R5, whereas R5 is intentionally smaller in both its ambitions and size.
