# R5

Minimalist HTML templating library with declarative data and event binding and reactive updates, using standard ES Template Literals.

R5 is highly _unopinionated_ - you can use it with (or without!) any component and/or state architecture you desire.

## Similarity to lit-html

Yes it is very similar in many ways! lit-html is an excellent library, and has quite a few more features than R5, whereas R5 is intentionally smaller in both its ambitions and size.
